# Something Awesome

Attached is all the code for my Something Awesome, "Printerception". There are two important folders here:

- `fake_printer` contains all the code for the external Heroku server (using Flask, Svelte and Tailwind).
- `flask_server` contains all the code for the print server hosted using Flask on my Raspberry Pi.

`logbook.txt` is my logbook, with all the contributions I made summarised in dot-point form. For detailed instructions on how to run the code, please consult the report (a Markdown copy available in `report.md`).
