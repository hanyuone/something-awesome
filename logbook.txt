Week 1:
- Came up with basic idea for idea
- Emailed to Frank, cleared up idea

Week 5:
- Bought SD card and SD reader online, waiting for their delivery

Week 6:
- Flashed Raspbian onto SD card
- Installed Raspbian onto Pi, began basic setup of CUPS

Week 7:

Wednesday:
- Managed to get a print server working, trying to go into /var/spool/cups and accessing files to harvest more information
- Plan: somehow intercept information being received at Raspberry Pi
- Considering switching over to OpenWRT, but might be too much effort

Thursday:
- Tried using Scapy to scrape IPP requests coming in, no dice – print instructions ended up being sent over, I need raw files
- Considering: using Svelte/Flask to run a mini server on the Pi, and use pycups to print stuff over to the printer
    - While printer is busy printing files, send a copy of that file to my “sniffer” server, which stores every document printed
- Asked for 2-day extension from Frank

Friday:
- Svelte doesn’t seem like a good fit for the print server, planning to have Svelte used for my sniffer website instead
- Fixed printer so that it runs the right printer driver
- Implemented basic print server, I can upload files to a local address and it’ll print those files for me through PyCUPS
    - Because I’m transferring files, the print server can actually send a copy of that file off to another server

Sunday:
- Finished uploading to Heroku, that’s all set up
    - Cannot upload files directly to Heroku, since that needs AWS (files aren’t persistent) – instead, we’ll upload the details of each print job
    - Requires us to sniff out the details of our last print job (and somehow get the ID of the print job when printing to ensure we get the right job)
- Need to finish off the Svelte app, configure interop between Flask and Svelte (probably not using HTTP request, since I can just serve the static page)

Week 8:

Monday:
- Finished setting up Tailwind
- Finished wiring up print job stuff to print server, waiting until the job is finished and then transferring data
- Still need to link up the Heroku server and my local print server, not very easy
    - Lots of bugfixing and testing

Wednesday:
- Everything is hooked up, I can send printer data to the Heroku server without a hitch
- Now it’s just cleaning up and bugfixing, as well as design improvements
- Should also start writing up the report

Thursday:
- Added some styling to the website, still need to test it a little
- Started writing up report, very basic draft

Friday:
- Finished report (for the most part) - still some cleaning up to do
- Brainstormed video script, finished rough draft

Saturday:
- Added some extra details to the report, mostly in terms of build instructions, what instructions I added to get servers to launch on startup
- Finished filming & editing video
